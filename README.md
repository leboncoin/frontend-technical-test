# Context :

At leboncoin, our users can share messages about a transaction, or ask for informations about any products.

Your job is to create the interface to consult those messages.
The interface needs to work on both desktop & mobile devices.

In addition to your code, a README explaining your thought process and your choices would be appreciated.

# Exercice :

- Display a list of all the conversations
- Allow the user to select a conversation
  - Inside the conversation, there is a list of all the messages between these two users.
  - As a user, you can type and send new messages in this conversation

**As your application can be used by millions of users, make sure to provide some robust safety guards.**

### Sketches :

Obvisouly, it is up to you to make something nice and pretty, you are free to design it the way you like. The sketches are here to give you an idea on how it should look.

## Bonus 1 :

We provide some conversation samples, but can you improve the app so the user can now create new conversations ?

## Bonus 2 :

Our infrastructure is a bit shaky.. Sometimes the servers are crashing. “It’s not you, it’s me”, but maybe you can display something nice to warn the user and handle it gracefully.

## Do you want to make the app even better ?

Feel free to make as many improvements as you like.
We love creativity and technical challenges.

If you are out of ideas, here are some thoughts :

- As we want to reach our users anywhere, we need to make sure the app is performing well. What can you do to make it really fast ?

- Our goal is to support everybody in the country, including people with disabilities. As a good citizen and a good developer, can you make sure the app is accessible for everyone ?

- We all love to relax after a hard day’s work. It would be a shame if we didn’t feel confident enough about the upcoming automatic deployment. Are you sure everything has been tested thoroughly ?

## Process (Arnaud Lambert)

I started with development of the state management, a simple store with useContext/useReducer. Api calls are checked by Zod to confront with validation schema (Event though I had some difficulties after to create messages and conversations due to inconsistencies in API).
On UI, I simply use TailwindCSS for quickness.
