## Main steps of my work
- I started by focusing on the main goals : show conversations, display one, add new messages
- I installed the necessary dependencies for linting & code formating in Typescript
- I picked up SWR to handle requests, pulling, errors, & retries
- Concerning look & feel, Tailwind is the de facto standard on Next. I also picked a free layout https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/example-chat
- I started by implementing the chat page, which was the major feature. Concerning requests' handling I installed react-hot-toast which is really sexy with tailwind
- at this point an essential part of my work consisted in the server side implementation. I had to make the DB more "realistic" by defining "real" conversations and timestamps. When I handle db's collections I like to use Ramda, which is the best functional programming JS lib I know. 
- defining an index.js for json-server allowed me to initialize the DB in a good state
- concerning date manipulation & formating, I'm used to date-fns, which is clearly smaller than moment.js
- once I was able to add new messages I focused on the feature : "create a new conversation"
  - I love daisyUi components for their "css only" behaviors. so I picked this lib
  - once the drawer UI was implemented I jumped to the server side to handle the conversation POST in two way : either create new conversation or update an existing one. and do a redirect accordingly
- at this point all of the features were implemented, even bonuses.
- I created unit tests, essentially on "dummy components" (UI only)
- As a public app, the code should be accessible. so I refactor the markup to be semantic and added aria attributes. Also I enforced auto focusing behaviors to help keys navigation
- Finally I did a cleanup of my code, enforcing typings.
